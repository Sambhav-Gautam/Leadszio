      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

      <p>Last updated: 31-10-2025</p>

      <p>
        Welcome to Leadszio (“we”, “us”, “our”). This Privacy Policy describes how we handle
        information in connection with our website hosted at <strong>leadszio.vercel.app</strong>
        (the “Website”). Leadszio is a B2B company that provides information about lead-generation,
        digital marketing and website services to other businesses.
      </p>

      <h2>Summary</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Short version:</strong> At present the Website is informational only and we do not
        operate a backend that collects, stores, or processes personal data from visitors via forms,
        signups, or accounts. If that changes (for example we add contact forms, analytics with
        personal data, or marketing tools), we will update this Privacy Policy and add a consent
        mechanism where required.
      </p>

      <h2>1. Scope &amp; Applicability</h2>
      <p>
        This Privacy Policy applies to persons who visit or interact with the Website. It does not
        cover personal data collected offline or via any separate contract between Leadszio and a
        client (those will be governed by separate agreements).
      </p>

      <h2>2. What we currently collect (Minimal / Technical data)</h2>
      <p>
        Because the Website is informational and has no backend forms, we do not intentionally
        collect names, emails, phone numbers, or other personally identifiable information (PII).
        However, basic technical / system logs may be generated and retained by our hosting provider
        (Vercel) and by intermediary infrastructure (for example: HTTP access logs). These logs
        typically include non-identifying technical information such as:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>IP address (may be anonymized or aggregated by hosting provider)</li>
        <li>Browser and device type, user agent</li>
        <li>Pages visited and timing of requests</li>
        <li>Referring URL and basic diagnostics</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Such data is used only for maintaining the Website, troubleshooting outages, and protecting
        security. It is processed in aggregated or limited form and is not used to identify or
        contact an individual.
      </p>

      <h2>3. Cookies and third-party tools</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Current state:</strong> We do not set site cookies that collect personal data. If we
        introduce cookies or third-party analytics/marketing (for example Google Analytics, Hotjar,
        Tag Managers, or marketing pixels) we will:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>disclose them here,</li>
        <li>explain what they do, and</li>
        <li>deploy a cookie consent banner to capture granular consent before non-essential cookies are used.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        If you see cookies from third-party websites (for example embedded widgets or external links),
        those third parties’ privacy policies apply to their cookies — not ours. We recommend
        reviewing the privacy policies of any external service you use.
      </p>

      <h2>4. Third-party services &amp; links</h2>
      <p>
        The Website may contain links to external sites (e.g., partner sites, social profiles,
        analytics dashboards). We are not responsible for the privacy or security practices of those
        sites. Please review their privacy terms before providing personal information to them.
      </p>

      <h2>5. If you contact us</h2>
      <p>
        If you contact us by email (for example using contact@leadszio.com) we will receive the
        information you send (your email address and any message content). That information is used
        only to respond to your enquiry and is retained only as long as necessary to resolve your
        request or as required by law.
      </p>

      <h2>6. Data retention</h2>
      <p>
        Technical logs retained by our hosting provider are stored according to the provider’s
        retention policy. If we receive personal information (for example by email), we retain it
        only for as long as necessary to address the request, comply with legal obligations, or for
        legitimate business purposes. You may contact us to request deletion.
      </p>

      <h2>7. Data security</h2>
      <p>
        We implement reasonable technical and organisational measures to protect information we
        may receive (for example TLS encryption for data in transit). We restrict access to any
        stored data to authorised personnel only. Please note that no system is completely secure,
        and we cannot guarantee absolute security of any information you transmit to us.
      </p>

      <h2>8. Data breaches — what we will do</h2>
      <p>
        In the unlikely event of a security incident that results in unauthorised access to personal
        data we control, we will promptly take steps to investigate and contain the incident, and
        where applicable will notify affected individuals and relevant authorities consistent with
        legal obligations and best practice. If we begin processing personal data on a larger scale
        in the future (for example offering user accounts), we will publish a more specific breach
        notification procedure and timeframes.
      </p>

      <h2>9. Rights of data subjects / data principals</h2>
      <p>
        Under India’s Digital Personal Data Protection Act and generally accepted data protection
        practices, data subjects have rights including — subject to legal exceptions — the right to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>request access to their personal data;</li>
        <li>request correction or update;</li>
        <li>request deletion/erasure (where retention is no longer necessary or lawful);</li>
        <li>withdraw consent for processing (if consent is the legal basis);</li>
        <li>object to processing on legitimate grounds; and</li>
        <li>complain to the Data Protection Board / regulator if they believe their rights are violated.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Because we do not currently collect personal data through the Website, these rights are not
        materially applicable today. If we begin to process personal data, we will publish a clear
        request procedure and respond to valid requests within a reasonable time (generally within
        30 days where feasible).
      </p>

      <h2>10. Children</h2>
      <p>
        The Website is not intended for children. We do not knowingly collect personal information
        from persons under the age of 18. If you believe that a minor has provided us with personal
        information, please contact us and we will take appropriate measures.
      </p>

      <h2>11. Cross-border transfers</h2>
      <p>
        Hosting and technical services for the Website may be provided by vendors that process data
        in different countries. If any personal data is transferred across borders we will ensure
        appropriate safeguards are in place in line with applicable law before doing so.
      </p>

      <h2>12. Legal requests</h2>
      <p>
        We may disclose information (including any personal data we receive by email) in response to
        lawful requests by public authorities (e.g., to meet national security or law-enforcement
        requirements), or to defend our rights in litigation.
      </p>

     

      <h2>13. Changes to this policy</h2>
      <p>
        We may modify this Privacy Policy at any time. When we do, we will update the “Last updated”
        date on this page. If we introduce material changes (for example enabling user accounts or
        personal data collection), we will post clear notice and obtain consent where required.
      </p>

      <h2>14. Miscellaneous</h2>
      <p>
        This Privacy Policy is governed by the laws of India. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in
        this document creates any contractual rights between you and Leadszio beyond those required
        by applicable law.

        <strong>Note:</strong> This Privacy Policy is a template designed to be defensive and
        transparent given that the Website is informational only. It is recommended you obtain
        legal review before publishing, and update this policy immediately if you enable any
        feature that collects personal data (contact forms, signups, analytics with IP retention,
        email marketing, etc.).
